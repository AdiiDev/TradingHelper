## App review

During the initial launch of the program at the client's end, a configuration page will be displayed. The client will be required to set up necessary components to proceed with the application. Once the configuration is completed, the client will be able to start using the application. Later on, the configuration can be modified in the application settings.

The Trades page is where we can add, edit, and delete trades. It serves as a centralized hub for storing all the data related to our trades. With the added functionalities of table configuration and filtering using the sidebar drawer, we can conveniently manage our trades. By adding a broker context to the application, we can make decisions throughout the entire application about which broker we want to trade with.

The widget page is the centerpiece of this application, serving as the command center for every respectable trader. It offers the ability to view countless trades on a single screen. Furthermore, users can create custom page layouts and navigate between them seamlessly. Additional drawers provide quick access to essential data for trade analysis.

Our application offers multiple options that allow users to customize its functionality according to their individual preferences. One of these features is the ability to choose between a dark or light theme, allowing users to adjust the app's appearance to their visual preferences. Additionally, the application provides the option to switch between English and Polish languages, enabling users to use the app in their preferred language. This flexibility allows users to personalize the application according to their needs and preferences.

## Optimizations

By migrating our application from Create React App (CRA) to Vite, we have significantly optimized its performance. Vite's fast build times and efficient development server have greatly improved our development workflow. The instant hot module replacement and on-demand compilation provided by Vite have resulted in faster reloading and quicker feedback during development.

## Debugging Numerology App


**Front-end:**

```
npm run win,  debugger,  console.log()
```
**Back-end:**

**Back-end-WIN:** 
While debugging the Windows version of the application on the backend side, it was necessary to use Visual Studio's debugging features. 

```
 This involved selecting "Debug" from the menu, then choosing "Attach to Process," and finally selecting the specific process to attach to.
```

## Build
